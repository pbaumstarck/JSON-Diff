JSON-Diff
=========

An AngularJS application for creating a visual diff between two JSON objects.

Demo instance available at: http://jsondiff.itsagoldenage.com/

To accommodate the recursive nature of the AngularJS templates, we had to have only one top-level template file, and then declare the rest of the templates inline in JavaScript.
